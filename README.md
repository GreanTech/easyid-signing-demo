# Welcome to the easyID digital agreement signatures demo repository

*If you need a legally binding signature on some text document from your customers - then look no further.
`easyID` will get you going in a few minutes*

To make this happen on your own website(s), you'll need 2 things:
- An `easyID` account (you can sign up for a free test account on [grean.com](https://www.grean.com))
- A small amount of work on your website

You can use the guide below, and the contents of this repository, as a step-by-step guide to providing your website with signed agreements from your users.

## A bit of technical context
This demo contains the code needed to get the signing process up and running on .NET.
But any platform that can validate signed Json Web Tokens can be used.
